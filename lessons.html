                <h2>Practice Metronome</h2>
                <p>Consistent practice with a metronome is essential for developing solid timing and rhythm. This tool will help you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Build steady tempo control</li>
                    <li>Improve your internal sense of timing</li>
                    <li>Develop muscle memory for complex patterns</li>
                    <li>Track your progress as you increase speed</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="metronome-tip"><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Start slow and focus on accuracy before increasing tempo. It's better to play correctly at 60 BPM than sloppily at 120 BPM!</p>
